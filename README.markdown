## What does it do?

It's just a simple GUI wrapper around a regexp parser call using Macruby. It
displays the results of the entire match ($0) on the first line, and the
results of positional matches are displayed in the appropriate windows
($1 through $9).

It's mainly a learning exercise using Macruby, Lion and Xcode although it is a
handy little utility to have around.  Feel free to send me requests for any
additional functionality you'd like to see.
